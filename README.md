# Braille_translator
Here I have created a braille translator app using streamlit and python.
This app has a friendly user interface quite handy for the blind population.
The main features of this app are:
1. Given any language it can translate it into braille and then using our low cost printer you can also get the hardcopy of the same.
2. Also given braille text you can translate into any language and then with an incorporated sound system you can also listen it.

   
Here are the Images for the same:-
